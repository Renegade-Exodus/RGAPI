     I make no guarantees of any kind to the programmer who uses this API, or
to the user who receives a program with this unit implemented.  This unit has
worked for me for over a year while I have used it privately, and therefore I
cannot foresee it having any problems with others.  However, I cannot possibly
test the unit under every possible setup condition, therefore I cannot
guarantee how well it will work under any given condition.  With this in mind,
by using this unit, or any product made with this unit, I am not held
responsible for any damages which may occur.

     I strongly encourage all programmers who use this unit to make a similar
notice in your program documentation to protect both mine and your interests.

쳐 INTRODUCTION
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     The RGAPI unit was formed by the need for set routines to do some of the
more tedious tasks in Renegade utility programming (such as open and closing
files, reading records etc..).  This is the reason RGAPI was formed.  I made
it so that no matter what program I was writing, I could easily and quickly
access all of Renegade's data files, without having to go through the huge
mess that comes with file handling.  The RGAPI does all the file handling for
you, returning only the Input/Output result (IOResult) to let you know what
happened.

     THIS UNIT WAS NOT DESIGNED SO THAT AN AMATEUR COULD JUMP RIGHT IN TO
PROGRAMMING FOR RENEGADE, IT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE LIFE EASIER!  Ever since I
first told a few people that I would be putting this package together, I have
heard things like "great, now I don't need to learn that section to program
for Renegade".  This is not the case, while it is possible to get by writing
programs without the knowledge of what is going on, it is rather pointless to
do so.  This unit uses some fairly complex ideas (since Renegade does, this
unit must) and I would not encourage anybody who does not have a fair to good
knowledge of Pascal (if an excellent knowledge then great) to use this.  It is
not an amateur's toy, but rather a professional's tool.  Do not abuse the idea
of this unit being there, as if you don't understand it, your programs could
easily backfire because of this unit.

쳐 PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS IN RGAPI
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     Now for the absolute pleasure of writing out what each and every
procedure and function does.  Forgive me for the fact that I am going to group
procedures and functions together as many procedures do the exact same thing
except for different files, and I don't wish to re-type everything 25 times.

     I will only be outlining the PROCEDURES and FUNCTIONS which would be used
by programmers, even though others are in there and can be called if the
programmer wishes.  A perfect example of this is the UNIX TIMESTAMP
conversion.  There are 5 PROCEDURES/FUNCTIONS available, however, only three
of them would normally have purpose of being called by the programmer, so only
those three will have write-ups in here.  If you feel you must know what
others do, contact me and I will tell you.

     I wish to acknowledge SWAG and Brian Stark of Digital Illusions for the
UNIX time routines.

旼 FUNCTION LZero(W: Word): String;
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This FUNCTION returns a STRING which will have the number passed to it
with a leading zero.  It will only attach a leading zero if the number is 1
digit.  For example, if "8" is passed, LZero will return "08", if "12" is
passed, LZero will return "12".

旼 FUNCTION Norm2Unix(Y, M, D, H, Min, S: Word): LongInt;
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This FUNCTION takes the date and time in DOS format, and returns a UNIX
TIMESTAMP in LongInt (Long Integer) format taking into account everything from
Leap Years to Time Zone's.

旼 PROCEDURE Unix2Norm(Date: LontInt; VAR Y, M, D, H, Min, S: Word);
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This PROCEDURE takes the date and time in UNIX TIMESTAMP format and
returns the date in DOS format with Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute and Second.

旼 FUNCTION TodayInUnix: LongInt;
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This FUNCTION merely access' DOS and gets the Date and Time, then calls
the Norm2Unix function to save the programmer time if s/he is using the
current date/time as their computer states it.

旼 PROCEDURE WriteColor(VAR SchemeDatIn: SchemeRec; VAR InStr);
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This PROCEDURE changes the colors while writing a STRING from Renegade to
the screen.  It has the ability to use both pipe (|) and carat (^) color
codes.  Because the (^) codes are from SCHEME.DAT, that file must be opened
prior to using this PROCEDURE and a VARIABLE of TYPE SchemeRec must be passed
to the PROCEDURE.

旼 FUNCTION StripColor(VAR InStr): String;
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This FUNCTION strips all color codes from the STRING passed to it,
allowing Renegade STRINGS to be displayed in any color the programmer wishes
to use.

旼 PROCEDURES FOR OPENING DATA FILES
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     The PROCEDURES for opening any of the data files, are named specifically
by the file being opened.  For example, RENEGADE.DAT is opened by calling the
OpenRenegadeDat PROCEDURE.  All of the open PROCEDURES require a PATH, and an
Errorlevel variable to be passed, and a couple of them require a filename as
well (such as opening *.HDR and *.DIR files).

旼 PROCEDURES FOR READING DATA FILES
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     The PROCEDURES for reading any of the data files, are named in the same
fashion as opening the files.  These PROCEDURES require that a variable of the
file type be passed, and some even require that a record number be passed (the
lowest record number being 0).

旼 PROCEDURES FOR WRITING DATA FILES
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     The PROCEDURES for writing any of the data files works exactly as the
reading.

旼 PROCEDURES FOR CLOSING DATA FILES
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     The PROCEDURES for closing any of the data files works simply by calling
the procedure in the same fashion as opening, where the format for
RENEGADE.DAT would be CloseRenegadeDat.

旼 PROCEDURE FileDate(S: String; VAR Y, M, D: Word);
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

     This PROCEDURE takes the date in STRING format from the files listings
and converts it to WORD VARIABLES to be manipulated in that fashion.
